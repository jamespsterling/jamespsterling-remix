              Full-stack software engineer with 14+ years of experience crafting software for SaaS
              platforms, enterprise deployments, and everything in between. My focus is to leverage
              the entire stack, back-end, middleware, and front-end to deliver thoughtful UI/UX
              experiences. My passion for self-documenting, scalable, and robust software
              orchestrations drives me to learn from and coach other engineers in best practices,
              refine developer experience (DX) tooling, and continuously hone my craft as a curious
              engineer.
