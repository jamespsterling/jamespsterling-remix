An lightweight Angular web app to visualize "everything I care about" (eekä). Using Angular & ExpressJs along with Google Cloud Datastore this app is a passion project to put many disconnected things in one place. Aggregating data from IoT smart devices (Personal Weather Station, HVAC, etc) with GCP Cloud Functions, I am then able to retrieve and display meaningful real-time data using Apache ECharts. Integrating many other 3rd party services such as DarkSky, The Weather Channel, YouTube, Google Maps, TradingView, and many others I am able to consolidate the sheer number of apps and services all in one place–constantly evolving.
