- Build new user-facing features and scalable UI components using **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwindcss**, **Storybook**, & **TanStack Query**.
- Working closely with the product and design team to implement complex feature concepts from zero-to-one, back to front.
- Architect and build scalable serverless back-end components using **Typescript**, **Nodejs**, **Prisma**, **TypeGraphQL**, **GraphQL**, & **MongoDB**.
- Champions DX improvements to help alleviate pain-points around hot-reload inefficiencies at scale, optimize test performance with **@swc/jest**, slow **Next.js** compile times, & 50x improvement in monorepo linting speed with **Biomejs**.
- Works to establish baseline **clean-code** concepts, importance of **type-safety**, & **separation-of-concerns** principals.
- Plays a key role in implementing event-driven back-end architecture using **Temporal** to both rebuild legacy software orchestration and prepare for highly scalable [Automations Engine](https://thinkaidium.com/mortgage-automation) & async background tasks processing achieving new levels of real-time observability as well as high throughput.
- Leads effort to migrate from code-first to schema-first GraphQL API implementation using **GraphQL Codegen** & native **GraphQL.js** to improve troubled DX, reduce significant tech debt, and setup for future scale.
