title: "Fullstack Software Engineer"

Full-stack software engineer with 15 years of experience crafting software for SaaS platforms, enterprise deployments, and everything in between. My focus is to leverage the entire stack, back-end, middleware, and front-end to deliver thoughtful UI/UX experiences. My passion for self-documenting, scalable, and robust software orchestrations drives me to learn from and coach other engineers in best practices, refine developer experience (DX) tooling, and continuously hone my craft as a curious engineer.
