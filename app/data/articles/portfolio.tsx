              It is also not optimized to use the latest and greatest of hosting platforms such as

            <p className="mb-6">
              Since version 1 was built on mostly HTML & CSS, migrating the bulk of the content was
              simple using Remix. After creating a new repo and linking that repo to Cloudflare via
              Github, CI/CD is basically setup thereafter and by default will auto-deploy anything
              pushed to <span className="font-mono text-orange-700 dark:text-orange-500">main</span>

            <p className="mb-6">
              Since most of my styles were written in a single SASS file, I wanted to leverage
              better organization by modularizing my SASS. Doing this helps tremendously with the
              cognitive load of find and updating styles that apply to only a single component or
              page of my app.

            <p className="mb-6">
              Asset loading has long been something you might link out to as a 3rd-party CDN host
              which comes with security concerns and risk for downtime. Asset loading fonts & icons
              can be greatly improved by self-hosting said assets. By moving assets like fonts local
              to your application, not only can this help reduce external requests during or after
              rendering, it can aid in eliminating{' '}
